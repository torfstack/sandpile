# Fractal Generation using Sandpiles

A sandpile is a (N x N) grid, filled with non-negative integer values. 
A *normalized* sandpile contains no values greater than 3. If a cell contains a value greater than 3, the value 4 is subtracted from it and the value of all neighboring cells is incremented by 1.
